==== Build instructions ====
============================

JARs for Copper may be built via the ANT script located in the repository's
root directory, by building the "dist" target:  

% ant dist

This will place two JARs into the jar/ directory:

* CopperRuntime.jar contains only the classes necessary to run a main-line
  Copper parser. It does not include the parser generator, or code to run
  parsers based on experimental or deprecated engines.
* CopperCompiler.jar contains all Copper's classes.

Once the JARs are built, you need only put one of them in your classpath.
Copper has no dependencies outside of the Java 1.5 standard class library.

If you will only be running Copper parsers (e.g., if you are running an
application that contains a Copper parser), you may use either JAR. If
you are developing Copper parsers or using experimental or deprecated
features, you must use CopperCompiler.jar.
